### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?

RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.

### How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?

Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses
